//In the following statement, the db object is using the all() method. This method runs the SQL query
//and executes the callback with all the resulting rows that match the query.

//Once this method executes the SQL command, the callback function captures the responses from the query
//in two variables: the err, which is the error response, and rows, which is the database query response.
//If there are no errors in the SQL query, the err value is null. This method is the key component that
//allows SQL commands to be written in a Node.js application.



//api call for the candidates table
//Let's review the preceding route. We've built a lot of the logic already. We just need to incorporate the
// route's callback function to receive requests and send back responses.
//
//We'll use the get() method to retrieve all the candidates from the candidates table. This route is
// designated with the endpoint /api/candidates. Remember, the api in the URL signifies that this is an
//  API endpoint.
//
//The callback function will handle the client's request and the database's response. The request-response
// pattern should look familiar from the last module.
//
//We'll wrap the get() method around the database call we made earlier and modify it a bit. The SQL statement
// SELECT * FROM candidates is assigned to the sql variable. Here we set the params assignment to an 
// empty array because there are no placeholders in the SQL statement.
//
//We use the all() method from the database object to retrieve all the rows. In the error-handling 
//conditional, instead of logging the error, we'll send a status message 500 and the error message 
//in a JSON object. The 500 status code means there was a server errorâ€”different than a 404, which 
//indicates a user request error. The return statement will exit out of the database call once an error 
//is encountered.

//Let's break this route down to its component parts to see how it works. In this case, we must use the

//The endpoint used here also includes a route parameter to uniquely identify the candidate to remove. 
//Again, we're using a prepared SQL statement with a placeholder. We'll assign the req.params.id to 
//params, as we did in the last route.
//
//The database call uses the ES5 function callback, to use the Statement object's changes property.
//
//The JSON object route response will be the message "successfully deleted", with the changes property 
//set to this.changes. Again, this will verify whether any rows were changed.

//Let's walk through the following code. Notice that the database call here uses a prepared statement that's a bit 
//different than the one we used previously in the lesson. This is because there is no column for the id. SQLite 
//will autogenerate the id and relieves us of the responsibility to know which id is available to populate.
//
//The params assignment contains three elements in its array that contains the user data collected in req.body.
//
//The database call logic is the same as what we previously built to create a candidate. Using the run() method, we c
//an execute the prepared SQL statement. We use the ES5 function in the callback to use the Statement object that's 
//bound to this. Then we send the response using the res.json() method with this.lastID, the id of the inserted row. 
//Also included in the response is the success message and the user data that was used to create the new data entry.
